# UX-Coding-Submission

I wanted to make sure I created a responsive webpage this is why I created bespoke CSS for 3 different media brackets. Mobile was set to Max width 414px to match the largest width size used for mobiles and 1024px to accomadate smaller desktop monitors, small laptop displays and tablets. 

I used two text links and changed my third text link into a button link because I felt the content and action required of the user fit a button better than just a text link. 

I used https://colourcontrast.cc/ to make sure my website was accessible and passed AA standards.

I used the free chrome extension screen reader to test that my webpage was accessbile to the visually impaired. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en
